            <p>As far as I can remember, I loved learning and making things, I would go through a lot of intense phases of interest in different topics. I have always been a very creative kid, but when I was 12 years old I was exposed to the world of digital art and animation as a skill you realistically can learn, at the same time in 6th-grade computer class I started learning basic C++ and most importantly HTML, after that I began being very invested in online content creation: graphic, video, written, coded, I wanted to do it all.</p>

            <p>
              My interests and skills related to art and tech grew as time went on. Even though I had a social sciences specialization in high school, not something prioritizing technical subjects, my ICT teacher encouraged me to participate in the ICT Olympiad: in 2019 I came first place in my county and won a silver medal at the National Olympiad.
            </p>
            <p>
              While my dreams of going to the Olympiad in the next few years were shattered by its cancellation due to the pandemic, I focused more on my artistic skills. I began doing freelance art commission work for whoever showed interest. My small side hustle proved itself quite successful after a while, which in 2021 led me to work for Quartz Apps, a small game studio making Discord bot games, I worked as a game asset artist and occasional marketing material artist for Bake.gg and Isles.gg.

          <h3>Moving forward</h3><hr>
          <p>
            I moved to Denmark in 2022 to study multimedia design at Business Academy Aarhus. Being a student at BAAA has been a great experience in many ways, it helped me solidify my skills and allowed me to see the good, the bad, and the surprises that come with teamwork. Working as a student assistant at BAAA’s library has also given me a real taste of seeing something you made making a difference, no matter how small, even if it’s bookmarks and posters.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside of my education and my job, I’m working on keeping up my online artists brand, Pink Sinsila, and developing the 2 animated web series I’ve wanted to make for years.
          </p>
          <p>
            As my time at BAAA is coming to a close, I am looking for a place that needs and appreciates my generalism, for just 10 weeks or even more.
